            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a student taking a Film noir class at IUPUI (Fall 2017). Sadly this is my first film class and I am woefully unprepared for the writting of the papers for this class and most of the readings fly over my head. In order to better understand and review the material I decided to put the content into a form that I am more familiar with - a web site.</p>
            <p>I have a few years experience of web design thanks to a community college (Southwestern Community College near Chula Vista, California), but it has been at least 3 years since then so my skills are a bit rusty. I am taking a refresher web design class at IUPUI as well this year so this site serves a dual purpose: 1) a better understanding and review of film noir and 2) practice with web design.</p>
