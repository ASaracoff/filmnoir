            <h2>Kiss Me, Deadly Discussion Notes</h2>
            <h3><em>Kiss Me, Deadly</em> (1955)</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Based on book by Mickey Spillaine</li>
					<li>UR (UnRated) - had it been rated it would of been bad</li>'
					<li>Book universally disliked by critics, but enormously popular</li>
					<li> - sold many books and grew the paperback industry</li>
					<li>Spillaine started writing comics at first (Captain America and Batman etc)</li>
					<li>1949 - "I the Jury" first book (Mike Hammer #1)
						<ul>
							<li>Graphic and perverse</li>
							<li>Anti-communist</li>
							<li>Defends against communist, fellow travelers, and anti-American spies</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Spillaine's Own Beliefs </h3>
				<ul>
					<li>He was anti-communist, patriot, unsupportive of McCarthy, seen as a fascist and masogynist</li> 
					<li>Liked Ann Rand (intelligent, wrote "Atlas Shrugged" and has a following of people, libertarian to the point of true altruism)</li> 
					<li>Early 1950s became a Jehovah Witness - went door to door distributing "Watch Tower"</li>
					<li>Nothing contrary between book and beliefs, "I don't have fans I have customers." </li>
					<li>Book sales in the millions</li>
					<li>Later in life he wrote children's books</li>
					<li>Appeared in Miller Light Commercials - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAcuoDYlgzM" target="_blank">"The Case of the Missing Case"</a></li>
					<li>His work influenced Frank Miller "Sin City"</li>
					<li>The Bond Franchise took over the detective scene</li>
				</ul>
			<h3><em>Kiss Me, Deadly</em></h3>
				<ul>
					<li>Best and most interesting version of the Mike Hammer books</li>
					<li>Mike a sleazy, erotic detective looking for the great 'whatzit'</li>
					<li>Spillaine didn't like what they did with his book, like changing the drugs to a bomb</li>
					<li>Film is thought of as art, like <a href="../films/dm.html" target="_blank"><em>Detour</em></a>, but Spillaine is not an artist, not the voice of the film</li>
					<li>Chandler is considered an artist</li>
					<li><em>Kiss Me, Deadly</em> got the public to review Spillaine, Chandler, and Hammett's work</li>
					<li><a href="../articles/bnc.html" target="_blank">Borde and Chaumeton</a> saw it as exploring the genre</li>
					<li>The movie was banned by the British, but the French saw it as ironic</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Discussion Questions</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>How is Mike Hammer different from Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe?</li>
					<li>What does <a href="../articles/gallafent.html" target="_blank">Gallafent</a> say about the difference between the novel and the film?</li>
					<li>What are Gallafent's major arguments about the women in this film?</li></li></li>
					<li>What are the recurrent images in the film?</li>
					<li>What does the ending mean? What do we do with the bomb blast at the end?</li>
					<li>What is the split between the art of the past and modern technology?</li>
					<li>How is race represented in this film?</li>
					<li>Do you think Hammer is un-self aware of his actions as Bannion in <a href="../films/bhm.html" target="_blank"><em>The Big Heat</em></a></li>
				</ol>
				<ul>
					<li>The bomb - sending noir out with "a bang"</li>
					<li>Recurring images: phones, boxes, speed, women, bombs, technology, violence, sports car, "Remember Me"</li>
					<li>Un-self aware - <a href="../films/kmdm.html#clips" target="_blank">Scene investigators:</a> He's aware he is bad, but does not know how bad (he think hes 'cool' - not bad). When he is told how bad it is he admits "I didn't know" (<a href="../films/kmdm.html#clips" target="_blank">Revealing Clip</a>)</li>
					<li>Marlowe vs Hammer: how the environment changes the character and then they have to confront themselves</li>
					<li>Race - <em>Kiss Me, Deadly</em> was more white-wash, black men in the gym and one in the bar - they do exist, in good light (but placed in the film where the scenes could easily be removed for the southern states)</li>
					<li>Women's representation - Mike pimped out his secretary out, or using a sleazy degraded way of doing business. Christine was maybe raped as well as tortured in the film. All women criticize Hammer and are attracted to him. The three main women have a scene where they are only wearing a robe of some sort - trench coat, cotton robe, and a dressing robe with no shoes.</li>
					<li>Unrestored version - they did <strong>not</strong> go into the sea, were they annihilated?</li>
					<li>If it is the Atomic blast or nuclear annihilation it doesn't matter if they're in the sea or not - it does not save them.</li>
				</ul>
			<h3>Marlowe vs Hammer</h3>

				</table>
				<p>It is like how the old detectives may evolve/devolve into a Mike Hammer</p>
				<p>"THE END" <a href="../films/kmdm.html#clips" target="_blank">scene</a> could also mean the end of the world. The atomic age was a topsy turvy age - so it all fits</p>
			<h3>Differences between book and film</h3>
				<p>Book</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Hammer is right wing vigilante war veteran</li>
					<li>Has a revenge narrative</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Film</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Some restrictions due to the <a href="../articles/prod.html" target="_blank">Production Code</a></li>
					<li>Hammer - sleazy divorce lawyer</li>
					<li>Hammer fascinated by power - not revenge</li>
					<li>Switch from drugs to atomic bomb</li>
					<li>Added the character Nick (Va Va Voom)</li>
				</ul>
				<h3><em>The Bandwagon</em></h3>
					<ul>
						<li>1953 clip from <em>The Bandwagon</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C9CoAbwxy0" target="_blank">"Girl Hunt"</a> scene is a spoof or parody of film noirs</li> 
						<li>It has all the tropes of noir (sadly the link is only part 2, the first half has more noir tropes)</li>
						<li>The American public recognized noir before they came up with a term to describe it</li>
					</ul>
				<h3>Other</h3>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="../films/toem.html" target="_blank"><em>Touch of Evil</em></a> is more deprived than <em>Kiss Me, Deadly</em></li>
						<li>Orson Welles always a leftist activist, pushed the boundaries</li>
						<li>Stars Orson Welles</li>
						<li>Thinking of borders - <strong>All Types of Borders</strong></li>
					</ul>
