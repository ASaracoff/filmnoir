            <h2>Laura Discussion Notes</h2>
            <h3>Opening <a href="../films/lm.html#clips" target="_blank">Scene</a></h3>
               <ul>
                    <li>Recollection while seeing his collection</li>
                    <li>Laura was his 'possession,' something to be obtained</li>
                    <li>Clocks were made for each other</li>
                    <li>Two males obsessed with Laura, but are opposites - doubles/doppelgangers</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Waldo (unreliable narrator) tells his story in flashback, no one can back his story. The character as well as the actor was gay</p>
               <p>Narration switches from Waldo to the detective 34 minutes into the film</p>
               <p>Unreliable Narration - unreliable characters</p>
               <p>Plot driven - who killed Laura?</p>
          <h3>Detective Falls in Love <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPeSymZSS2c&list=PLvU_Ua8Kt_leBTn9ZcsghrsmC0-YsaGIx&index=11" target="_blank">Scene</a></h3>
               <ul>
                    <li>Music score - highs and lows  on cue depending on what the detective does</li>
                    <li>Detective is 'taking possession' of Laura or Waldo's possessions</li>
                    <li>Waldo comes to try to take back his possessions and Detective says no</li>
                    <li>Transition of narration</li>
                    <li>Detective gets reflected by many surfaces</li>
                    <li>After this scene - when the camera zooms into the Detective then Laura enters - it could all be his dream (wish fulfillment</li>
                    <li>Game - keeps him calm, keeps throwing it to the side later in film</li>
                    <li>Baseball and lots of alcohol - traps him into being controlling of Laura (idea of a classmate)</li>
                    <li>If it is a dream - the ultimate abstract realism. Detective is basic his dream girl (ideal) based on another's unreliable view of Laura.</li>
                    <li>We only know Laura through others eyes</li>
                    <li>Very few details</li>
                    <li>Each narration/narrator is jealous of Laura</li>
               </ul>
            <h3>Noir Elements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rain</li>
                    <li>Shadowed light</li>
                    <li>Ambiguity</li>
                    <li>Low key lighting</li>
                    <li>Haunting - something bothering him (detective)</li>
                    <li>Drinking and Smoking</li>
               </ul>
               <p>Originally written (Play write) as a full dream with detective waking up... but he doesn't</p>
               <p>There's a tendency to make the 'bad' a dream sequence then the character wake up.</p>
          <h3>Subjective Narration and Gender Politics</h3>
               <ul>
                    <li>Male controlled narration</li>
                    <li>Laura defined by masculine desires</li>
                    <li>Never really addresses Laura's desire</li>
                    <li>Male desire around Laura</li>
                    <li>Portrait of Laura for the male eye</li>
                    <li>Portrait becomes the Detectives fetish, Waldo's anti-fetish</li>
                    <li>Detective falls in love with portrait, fascination to be projected</li>
                    <li>Novel has four narratives - Laura's narration is missing from the film</li>
               </ul>
          <h3>Discussion</h3>
               <ul>
                    <li>Laura is like the falcon in <a href="../films/mfm.html" target="_blank">The Maltese Falcon</a></li>
                    <li>Laura is seen as wearing 'slacks'</li>
