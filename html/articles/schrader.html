            <h4>by Paul Schrader</h4>

            <ul>
               <li>In 1946 French critics noticed the new mood that had crept into the Amercan cinema:
                    <ul>
                         <li>Cynicism</li>
                         <li>Pessimism</li>
                         <li>Darkness</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
               <li>Most evident in routine crime thrillers, but also apparent in prestigious melodramas</li>
               <li>As the years went by:
                    <ul>
                         <li>Hollywood lighting grew darker</li>
                         <li>characters more corrupt</li>
                         <li>themes more fatalistic</li>
                         <li>tone more hopeless</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
               <li>1949 American movies were in the throes of their deepes and most creative funk</li>
               <li>Never before have movies dared to take such a harsh uncomplimentary look at American years, and wouldn't dare to do so again for twenty years</li>
               <li>Recent fascination with film noir reflects recent trends in American cinema:
                    <ul>
                         <li>Again taking a look at the underside of the American character</li>
                         <li>The newer self-hate cinema of Dennis Hopper's <em>Easy Rider</em> (1969) and Haskell's <em>Medium Cool</em> (1969) seem naive and romantic compared to such cynical examples of noir as Robert Aldrich's <em>Kiss Me, Deadly</em> (1955), Gordon Douglas's <em>Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye</em> (1959)</li>
                         <li>As current political mood hardens, filmgoers and filmmakers will be more attracted towards the late 1940's film noir</li>
                         <li>The forties may be to the seventies what the thirties were to the sixties</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
               <li>Film noir interests critics:
                    <ul>
                         <li>offers writers a cache of excellent, little-known films</li>
                         <li>film noir: Hollywoods best periods and their least known</li>
                         <li>gives writters an oppurtunity to apply themselves to the new questions of classification and transdirectorial style - What is film noir?</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
          </ul>    
          <h3>What is Film Noir?</h3>
          <p>(p582)</p>
              <ul>
               <li>Not a genre - Raymond Durgnat "Paint it Black: The Family tree of Film Noir"</li>
               <li>Not defined as western and gangster movies are - by conventions of setting and conflict but rather by the more subtle qualities of <mark>tone and mood</mark></li>
               <li>It is a film "noir," as opposed to the possible variant of film "gray" or film "off-white"</li>
               <li>Specific period of film history - like German expressionism or the French New Wave</li>
               <li>In general - film noir refers to hollywood films of the forties and early fifties that portrayed the world of dark, slick city streets, crime and corruption</li>
               <li>Extremely unweildy period</li>
               <li>Harks back to many previous periods:
                    <ul>
                         <li>Warner's thirties gangster films</li>
                         <li>French "poetic realism" of Carne and Duvivier</li>
                         <li>Starnbergian melodramas</li>
                         <li>Ultimately - German Expressionist crime films (Lang's Mabase cycle)</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
               <li>Film noir stretches the limits:
                    <ul>
                         <li><em>The Maltese Falcon</em> - John Huston 1941</li>
                         <li><em>Touch of Evil</em> - Orson Wells 1958</li>
                         <li>Almost every dramatic Hollywood from 1941-1953 contains some film noir element</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
               <li>Foreign off-shoots of film noirs:
                    <ul>
                         <li><em>The Third Man</em> - Carol Reed 1949</li>
                         <li><em>Breathless</em> - Jean-Luc Godard 1959</li>
                         <li><em>Le Doulos</em> - Jean-Pierre Melville 1963</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
            </ul>
          <h3>Most Every Critic has...</h3>
          <ul>
               <li>Their own definition of film noir</li>
               <li>Personal list of film titles to back up their definition</li>
               <li>These can get a bit sticky, film noir is defined by tone rathher than genre
                    <ul>
                        <li>Almost impossible to argue with critics about their descriptive definitions</li>
                        <li>How many elements does it take to make a film noir?</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
               <li>Film noir, reduced to its primary colors (all shades of black), these cultural and stylistic elements all definitions must return to:
                    <ul>
                         <li>Influences</li>
                         <li>Stylistics</li>
                         <li>Themes</li>
                         <li>Phases</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Influences</h3>
          <p>Four main influences in Hollywood in the forties that brought about film noir are the war and postwar disillusionment, postwar realism, German Expatriates, and the hard-boiled tradition. Each catalytic elements, however, can define film noir; the distinct noir tonality draws from each of these elements.</p>
          <h4><em>War and Postwar Disillusionment</em></h4>
          <ul>
               <li>After WWII - acute downer hit, delayed reaction to the thirties</li>
               <li>The Depression movies were needed to keep peoples spirits up
                    <ul>
                         <li>Early crime films - Horatio Algerish and socially concious</li>
                         <li>End of the thirties - darker crime film
                              <ul>
                                   <li><em>You Only Live Once</em> - Fritz Lang 1937</li>
                                   <li><em>The Roaring Twenties</em> - Raoul Walsh 1939</li>
                              </ul>
                         </li>
                         <li>If not for the war, film noir would have hit full steam in the early forties</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
               <li>The produced Allied propaganda abroad and promoted patriotism at home, blunted the blossoming dark crime films</li>
               <li>Film noir thrashed in the studio system, not quite able to come towards full prominence</li>
               <li>During the war the first four film noir came out - but they lacked the noir bite of later film noirs
                    <ul>
                         <li><em>The Maltese Falcon</em> 1941</li>
                         <li><em>The Glass Key</em> - Heisler 1942</li>
                         <li><em>This Gun for Hire</em> - Frank Tuttle 1942</li>
                         <li><em>Laura</em> - Otto Preminger 1944</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
               <li>War was over - American films turned markedly more sordid</li>
               <li>For 15 years the pressures against American amelioristic (to make better or more tolerable) had been building up, and given freedom, audiences and artists were now eager to take a less optimistic view of things</li>
               <li>Disillusionment that many soldier, small businessmen, and housewife/factory employees felt in returning to peacetime economy was directly mirrored in the sordidness of the urban crime film</li>
               <li>Immediate postwar disilussionment was directly demonstrated in the following movies as a serviceman retruning from the war to find his sweetheart unfaithful or dead, or his business partner cheating him, or the whole society something less than worth fighting for:
                    <ul>
                         <li><em>Cornered</em> - Edward Dmytryk 1945</li>
                         <li><em>The Blue Dahlia</em> - George Marshall 1946</li>
                         <li><em>Dead Reckoning</em> - John Cromwell 1947</li>
                         <li><em>Ride the Pink Horse</em> - Robert Montgomery 1947</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
               <li>The war continues, but now antagonism turns with a new viciousness toward American society itself</li>
          </ul>
          <h4><em>Postwar Realism</em></h4>
          <ul>
               <li>After the war every film-producing country had a resurgence of realism</li>
               <li>First took form as crime documentaries:
                    <ul>
                         <li><em>House on 92nd Street</em> - Henry Hathaway 1947</li>
                         <li><em>Call Northside 777</em> - Henry Hathaway 1948</li>
                         <li><em>The Killers</em> - Robert Siodmak 1946</li>
                         <li><em>Brute Force</em> - Jules Dassin 1947</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
               <li>"Every scene was filmed on the actual location depicted" the publicity for the 1947 de Rochemont-Hathaway <em>Kiss of Death</em> proclaimed</li>
               <li>Even as authenticity fell, realistic exteriors remained a permanent fixture of film noir</li>
               <li>Postwar mood: public's desire for a more honest and harsh view of America would not be satisfied by the same studio streets they'd been watching for dozens of years</li>
               <li>Postwat realistic trend: broke film noir away from the high-class melodrama, placing it in the street with everyday people</li>
               <li>Retrospect: pre-de Rochemont film noir look is definitly tamer than postwar realistic films</li>
               <li>The studio look of these films blunted their sting, making them seem polite and conventional in contrast to later films.
                    <ul>
                         <li><em>The Big Sleep</em> - Howard Hawks 1946</li>
                         <li><em>The Mask of Dimitrios</em> - Jean Negulesco 1944</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
          </ul>
          <h4><em>The German Expatriates</em></h4>
          <ul>
               <li>Hollywood received many German expatriates in the twenties and thirties - these filmmakers and technicians had intergrated themselves into the American film establishment</li>
               <li>late forties - hollywood decided to paint it black, the germans where the best</li>
               <li>Germans where the greatest masters of chiaroscuro (pictorial representation in terms of light and shade without regard to color; 2. the arrangement or treatment of light and dark parts in a pictorial work of art; 3. the interplay of light and shadow on or as if on a surface)</li>
               <li>Influence of expressionist lighting has always been just beneath the surface of Hollywood films, it bursts out in full bloom in film noir</li>
               <li>Some well known Germans working in film noir:
                    <ul>
                         <li>Fritz Lang</li>
                         <li>Robert Siodmak</li>
                         <li>Billy Wolder</li>
                         <li>Franz Waxman</li>
                         <li>Otto Preminger</li>
                         <li>John Alton</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
               <li>On the surface: seemed incompatible with postwar realism with its harsh unadorned exteriors</li>
               <li>But it is the unique quality of film noir that it was able to weld seemingly contradictory elements into a uniform cycle with its reliance on artificial studio lighting</li>
               <li>Best technitians simply made all the world a sound stage, directing unnatural and expressionistic lighting onto realistic settings</li>
               <li>They show exhilarating combination of realism and expressionism</li>
               <li>Greatest master of noir: John Alton</li>
               <li>He was an expressionist cenematographer who could relight Times Square at noon if necessary</li>
               <li>His work equals that of German expressionist master as Fritz Wagner and Karl Freund</li>
          </ul>
          <h4><em>The Hard-Boiled Tradition</em></h4>
          <ul>
               <li>The "heard-boiled" school of writers</li>
               <li>1930s writers created the "tough," the cynical way of acting and thinking that separated one from the world of everyday emotions - romanticism with a protective shell:
                    <ul>
                         <li>Ernest Hemingway</li>
                         <li>Raymond Chandler</li>
                         <li>Dashiell Hammett</li>
                         <li>James M. Cain</li>
                         <li>Horace McCory</li>
                         <li>John O'Hara</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
               <li>Roots in pulp fiction or journalism</li>
               <li>Their protagonists lived out a narcisistic defeatist code</li>
               <li>hard-boiled hero was a soft egg compared to his existential counterpart, but a good deal tougher than anything American fiction had seen</li>
               <li>When the forties turned to the American "tough" moral understrata (the layer underneath the surface), these hard-boiled writers were ready with a preset conventions of heroes, minor characters, plots dialogue, and themes. </li>
               <li>This style was made to order for film noir, and influenced noir screenwriting as much as the Germans influenced noir cinematography</li>
               <li>Raymond Chandler was the most hard-boiled writers of Hollywood</li>
               <li>Wrote the script for <em>Double Indemnity</em> - best written and most characteristically noir of the period</li>
               <li>Showed noir for what it really was: small-time, unredeemed, unheroic; a break from romantic noir cinima</li>
               <li>Film noir, in its final stages, adapted and then bypased the hard-boiled school</li>
               <li>Manic, neurotic post-1948 filmsare all post-hard boiled: the air in these regions was even too thin for old time cynics like Chandler:
               <ul>
                    <li><em>Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye</em> - Mate 1950</li>
                    <li><em>Where the Sidewalk Ends</em> - Preminger 1950</li>
                    <li><em>White Heat</em> - Raoul Walsh 1949</li>
                    <li><em>The Big Heat</em> - Fritz Lang 1953</li>
               </ul>
               </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Stylistic</h3>
          <p>(pg 585)</p>
          <p>Film noir drew upon a reservoir of film techniques, some of the recurring techniques are:</p>
          <ol>
               <li>The majority of scenes are lit for night.</li>
               <li>Oblique and vertical lines are preferred to horizontal.They tend to splinter a screen, making it restless and unstable. Light enters in odd shapes - jagged trapezoids, obtuse triangles, verticle slits - one suspects the windows were cut out with a penknife. </li>
               <li>Actors and setting are often given equal lighting emphases. the actor is hidden in the realistic tableau of the city at night, his face is often blacked out by shadow as he speaks. when the environment is given equal or greater lighting than the actor, it creates a fatalistic or hopeless mood.There is nothing the protagonists can do; the city will outlast and negate even their best efforts.</li>
               <li>Compositional tension is preferred to physical action. </li>
               <li>Freudian attachment to water. Docks and piers are second only to alleyways as the most popular rendezvous points</li>
               <li>Love of romantic narration. <em>Laura, Double Indemnity, The LAdy from Shanghai, Sunset Boulevard</em> movies have narration that creates a mood of <em>temps perdu</em>, an irretrivable past, a predetermined fate, and an all-enveloping hopelessness. Pne can only take pleasure in reliving a doomed past.</li>
               <li>A complex chronological order is frequently used to reinforce the feelings of hopelesness and lost time. Films such as <em>The Enforcer, The Killers, Mildred Pierce, The Dark PAst, Chicago Deadline, Out of the Past</em> and <em>The Killing</em> use convoluted time sequences to immerse the viewer in a time-disorientating but highly stylized world. Manipulating time is used to reinforce a noir principle: <mark>the <em>how</em> is always more important than the <em>what.</em></mark></li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Themes</h3>
          <p>pg 587</p>
          <p>Raymond Durgnat has created a wonderful list of film noir themes in the British <em>Cinema</em> magazine Ibid. He has catogorized over 300 films into 11 themes, which some critics criticize. In each theme it is found that the upwardly mobile forces of the thirties have halted; frontierism has turned to paranoia and claustrophobia. </p>
          <ul>
               <li>The villain - gangsters have sit in the mayors chair</li>
               <li>The hero - private eye has quit the police force in disgust</li>
               <li>The heroine - sick of going along for the ride, is taking others for a rid</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Durgnat does not touch on the overriding noir theme: <mark>a passion for the past and present, but also a fear of the future. Film noir's tecniques emphasize loss, nostalgia, lack of clear priorities, and insecurity, then submerge these self-doubts in mannerism and style. Style becomes paramount; it is all that separates one from meaninglessness.</mark> Chandler described this fundamental noir theme - "It is not a very fragrant world, but it is the world you live in, and certain writers with tough minds and a cool spirit of detachment can make very interesting patterns out of it." ("The Simple Art of Murder")</p>
          <ul>
               <li>Heros - dread to look ahead, but instead try to survive by the day, and if unsuccessful at that, they retreat to the past</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Phases</h3>
          <p>Film noir can be put into three phases:</p>

               <li>Rise of McCarthy and Eisenhower</li>
               <li>Americans wanted to see a more bourgeois (of, relating to, or characteristic of the social middle class; 2: marked by a concern for material interests and respectability and a tendency toward mediocrity; 3: dominated by commercial and industrial interests: capitalistic) view of themselves</li>
               <li>Crime moved to the suburbs</li>
               <li>Criminals put on flanel suits</li>
               <li>Foot-sore cop turned into the "mobile unit" careening down expressways</li>
               <li>Social criticism was cloaked in ludicrous affirmations of the American way of life</li>
               <li>TV - demands for full lighting and close-ups undercut the German influence</li>
               <li>Color cinematography - the final blow to the noir look</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Film noir - a Creative Period</h3>
          <ul>
               <li>Most creative in Hollywoods history - if measured not by peak but by average</li>
               <li>Picked at random, a film noir is likely to be a better made fillm than a randomly selected silent comedy, musical, wester etc.</li>
               <li>Film noir achieved unusually high artisty</li>
               <li>brought out the best in everyone:
                    <ul>
                         <li>Directors ex. - Stuart Heisler, Robert Siodmak, Gordon Douglas, Edward Dmytryk, John Brahm, John Cromwell, Raoul Walsh, Henry Hathaway</li>
                         <li>Cameramen</li>
                         <li>Screenwriters</li>
                         <li>Actors</li>
                    </ul>
               </li>
               <li>Directors who began in film noir and never regained their original heighs, Ex: Otto Preminger, Rudolph Mate, Nicholas Ray, Robert Wise, Jules Dassin, Richard Fleisher, John Huston, Andre de Toth and Robert Aldrich (etc.)</li>
               <li>Director who made great film noirs and other great films are: Orson Wells, MAx Ophuls, Elia Kzan, Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock and Stanley Kubrick (etc.)</li>
               <li>message of film noir schema is irrefutable: <mark>film noir was good for practically every director's career</mark></li>
               <li>Two interesting exceptions: King Vidor and Jean Renoir</li>
               <li><mark>Film noir was a creative release for everyone involved</mark></li>
               <li>gave artists a chance to work with previously forbidden themes, yet had conventions strong enough to protect the mediocre</li>
               <li>Cinematographers were allowed to ecome highly mannered</li>
               <li>Actors were sheltered  by cinematographers</li>
               <li>It wasn't until years later that critics were able to distinguish between great directors and great noir directors</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Neglect of Film noir</h3>
          <ul>
               <li>Film noir's remarkable creativity makes it's neglect that much more baffling</li>
               <li>The French, of course, have been students of the period for sometime (<a href="bnc.html">Borde and Chaumeton 1955</a>)</li>
               <li>American critics have prefered westerns, musicals, or the gangster films to the film noir</li>
               <li>Some reasons for the neglect are superficial</li>
               <li>Others strike to the heart of film noir</li>
               <li>For some time film noir was considered an aberration of the American character: its emphasis on corruption and despair</li>
               <li>The western and the gangster films were considered more American than film noir</li>
               <li>Prefudice was reinforced by film noir being ideally suited to being a low-budget B film</li>
               <li>Economic snobbery - high-budget trash is better than low-budget trash, and to praise a B film is somehow to slight (often intentially) an A film</li>
               <li><mark>Fundamental reason for neglect: the fact that it depended on choreography than sociology, and American critics have always been slow on the uptake when it comes to visual style</mark></li>
               <li>Film noir is more interested in style than theme</li>
               <li>American critics have been sociologists first, scientists second: film importance related to large masses, and if it goes awry, its cause the theme has been "violated" by style</li>
               <li>Film noir operates on opposite principles: theme is hidden in style, and bogus themess are often flaunted that contradict the style.</li>
               <li>Style determines theme in every film</li>
               <li>Easier for sociological critics to discuss the themes of the western and the gangster film apart from stylistic analysis than it was to do for film noir</li>
               <li>Not surprisingly the gangster film was canonized in the <em>The Partisan Review</em> in 1989 in "The Gangster as Tragic Hero" by Robert Warshow</li>
               <li>Warshow was interested in the western and gangster films as "popular" art rather than as style</li>
               <li>Sociological orientation blinded Warchow, and many subsequent critics, to an aesthetically more important development in the gangster film - film noir</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>The Irony of Neglect</h3>
          <ul>
               <li>In retrospect the gangster films Warshow wrote about are inferior to film noir</li>
               <li>Thirties gangster - reflecion of what was happening in the country, Warshow analyzed thid=s</li>
               <li>Film noir, also a sociological reflect, - went further than the gangster film</li>
               <li>Film noir was engaged in a life-and-death struggle with the materials it reflected</li>
               <li>Tried to make America accept a moral vision of life based on style</li>
               <li>This contradiction - promoting style in a culture that valued themes - forced film noir into artistically invigorating twists and turns</li>
               <li>Film noir attacked and interpreted sociological conditions and created a new artistic world</li>
               <li>Went beyond a simple sociological reflection, a nightmarish world of American mannerism that was by far more a creation than reflection</li>
               <li>Film noir, first of all style, worked out its conflicts visually rather than thematically</li>
               <li>Aware of its own identity</li>
               <li>Was able to create artistic solutions to sociological problems</li>
               <li><em>Kiss Me, Deadly, Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye</em> and <em>Gun Crazy</em> can be works of art in ways that gangster movies like <em>Scarface, The Public Enemy,</em> and <em>Little Ceasar</em> can never be</li>
